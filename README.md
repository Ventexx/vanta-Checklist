---

A minimal checklist app. Single HTML file, no dependencies, no server — just open it in a browser.

---

## features

- **tasks** — add, check off, edit in-place, delete
- **separators** — visual dividers to group tasks into sections
- **drag to reorder** — grab the handle on any item and drop it where you want
- **undo / redo** — full history via Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y
- **profiles** — save named snapshots of your list; switch between them from the sidebar
- **import / export** — back up or restore your list as a `.json` file
- **themes** — three built-in themes: *focus*, *minimal*, *paper*
- **persistent settings** — last-used theme is saved to `localStorage` (or `vanta.settings.json` via the File System Access API)
- **zero dependencies** — one self-contained `.html` file

---

## getting started

```bash
# no install needed — just open the file
open vanta.html
```

Or drop it on any static file server. Works entirely offline.

## themes

Switch themes from the bar at the bottom of the screen.

| name | description |
|---|---|
| `focus` | near-black, teal accent — high contrast for deep work |
| `minimal` | dark grey, white accent — neutral and quiet |
| `paper` | warm cream, slate accent — easy on the eyes |

Theme preference is saved automatically.

## file structure

```
vanta.html              — the entire app (HTML + CSS + JS)
icon.png                — favicon
screenshotcover.png     — cover image (used in this README)
```

---

## local storage keys

| key | contents |
|---|---|
| `vanta_settings` | `{ theme: string }` |
| `vanta_profiles` | `{ profiles: Profile[], counter: number }` |

Profiles are stored as plain JSON arrays. Each profile holds a copy of the `items` array at save time.
